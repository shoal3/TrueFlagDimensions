# True Flag Dimensions

Stylish theme / userscript that converts 4chan's 16x11px flag icons to their true dimensions. Also updates and improves many flags.

### Installing

- Install the Stylish browser extension: https://userstyles.org/
- Afterwards, install the True Flag Dimensions theme: https://userstyles.org/styles/228027/4chan-true-flag-dimensions

Alternatively, install as a userscript: https://github.com/shoal3/TrueFlagDimensions/raw/main/4chan-true-flag-dimensions.user.js. Script does not work with 4chanX.

### Issues

If flags suddenly misalign then manually update the theme in the Stylish extension or replace the userscript. If you dislike a certain flag, think a flag's dimensions are wrong or want to provide feedback, then make a post about it on /flag/ + /extraflags/ (on /int/) and I'll resolve it. There are some flags where I intentionally used the wrong dimensions (e.g. 21x11px instead of 22x11px) to properly center a symbol with odd width.
